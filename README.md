Only use this repo to submit the final project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The script "run_analysis.R" returns a tidy data set containing average values, across activity types and subjects, for a range of measurements that themselves correspond to average and standard deviations of the signals generated by "wearable" devices. For more details on the experiment, variables in the tidy data set, and summary choices made, see the CodeBook. 

The script does not take any input, since it is assumed that all the necessary files to run the script have already been saved on the user's working directory. It merges the various files included in the original data set, extracting only the variables pertaining to the mean or standard-deviation of each measure (more on this in the CodeBook), to create a new data set.

Finally, it groups the observations contained in the new data set by activity type and subject, and returns the average of each variable, across the instances where they are observed. In other words, since each activity is performed multiple times by each subject (about 50), it summarizes the data by producing a second data set (the tidy data set), which only contains the average value of each variable for each activity type and subject.

The second file in this repo, the "CodeBook.md" file, corresponds to the CodeBook: it details every variable in the tidy data set (i.e. the output of the script described above), and what summary choices were made to get to this result.
